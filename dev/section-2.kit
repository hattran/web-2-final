            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>Wizardry and wonder fill the air each October when Chestnut Hill transforms for Witches and Wizards Weekend.</p>

            <p>Formerly the Harry Potter Festival, the Witches and Wizards festival weekend takes over the charming neighborhood for spellbinding events that morph the village into an enchanting magic-filled haunt.</p>
                
            <p>This two-day event starts a new tradition that combines ghosts of wizards-past and fun activities for the entire family across multiple locations in Chestnut Hill.</p>
                
            <p>Older witches and wizards can enjoy a Brews & Broomsticks pub crawl through outdoor beer gardens and have their fortunes told along the way.</p>
                
            <p>The next day, attendees to the afternoon-long festivities find fire-breathers, dancing zombies, hayrides, a costume parade and more. Thereâ€™s also a Quidditch tournament each year, and Woodmere Art Museum hosts a straw maze, too.</p>
